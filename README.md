# WhatsUpGitHub

## Setup Token

Currently, this project reads in your GitHub token from the shell environment.
For example either use or add to your shell rc:

```bash
export GITHUB_AUTH=your_token_here
```

## Running

To run this project please install via pip

```bash
pip install .
```

Then run the following command

```bash
whatsupgithub
```

For now, there are no extra parameters or conditions to add. A table should just
be produced for you to use!
